# PROJECT NAME

jQuery-SQL Weekend To-Do List App

## Description

_Duration: 12 hours_

I wanted to create an app to display my grasp of server and database routes and how they interact with javaScript and jQuery functions.

This app functions exactly how an analog to-do list would. There is an input field near the top of the page where you enter in whatever task you want to get done over the weekend.
Hit `Enter` and your task is logged to the list right away. Once you get done with a task, to "cross it off" your list, just hit the complete button, and this task will be automatically moved to the bottom of your list. And when you are ready you can click the "Remove" button on the page to remove the task from your list.

Check out the deployed version of my app on Heroku! [WeekendTodo](http://shielded-wave-13982.herokuapp.com/)

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [postgresQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
- [express](https://expressjs.com/)

## Installation

1. Create a database named `weekend-to-do-app`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Once all dependencies are installed, run `npm start` in the terminal.
5. Open up your browser and go to `localhost:5000` to use the app.
6. You're good to go! Track those tasks.

## Usage
This app is meant to keep track of all the little things that slip away from us during the week. You can keep track of them all in one place so you don't forget, so whenever you get a free minute you can pull up the app, and choose a task to knock off your list!

1. Type whatever it is you want to get done into the text box.
2. Hit `enter` or click the submit button.
3. Track your tasks in an easy to read list.
4. Whenever you're finished with one, just hit the `Completed` button to cross a task off your list and knock it all the way to the bottom.
5. You can either look back at your all hard work,
6. Or use the `Remove` button to erase that task from your memory.
