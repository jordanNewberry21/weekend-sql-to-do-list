- [] CLIENT
    - [x] source in jQuery

    - [x] Render function:
        - [x] calls data array as parameter
        - [x] array goes into a for loop
        - [x] for loop appends the task data to my html table

            - [x] the string task itself
            - [x] and a default value of completed: false
         - [x] call function to send task to the server
    - [x] sendTaskToSever function:
        - [x] ajax POST route
        - [x] after POST is sent, clear the input field here
        - [x] call getTask function again
    - [] Complete task function:
        - [x] connected to complete task button

        - [] after status is changed to true
            - [] container element should change background color from a dark color to green to visualize being complete
            - [] the complete task button should become inactive, and look crossed out or unusable
    - [] Delete task function:
        - [] connected to delete button
        - [] ajax DELETE route
            - [] target task by it's id
